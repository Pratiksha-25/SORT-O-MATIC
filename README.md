# SORT-O-MATIC
**In this project, we aim to visualize the working of six commonly used sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.**

It offers an interactive, visual learning tool for sorting algorithms; implemented using C++ and SDL2 for performance efficiency.

## Features of project:-
- The tool will allow users to see how data is manipulated during the sorting process.
- Users will be able to select different sorting algorithmsto visualise.
- The projects stands out bu using C++ and SDL2 library.
- It also aids in comprehending the time complexities associated with different sorting algorithms.

## Working:-

A sorting algorithg is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate.
In this implementation of sorting visualizer, we'll be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visually comprehend their working.
The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.
The list size is fixed to 130 elements. You can randomize the list and select any type of sorting algorithm to call on the list from the given options. Here, all sorting algorithms will sort the elements in ascending order. The sorting time being visualized for an algorithm is not exactly same as their actual time complexities. The relatively faster algorithms like Merge Sort, etc. have been delayed so that they could be properly visualized.

# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
