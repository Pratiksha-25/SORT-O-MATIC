# SORT-O-MATIC
**In this project, we aim to visualize the working of six commonly used sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.**

It offers an interactive, visual learning tool for sorting algorithms; implemented using C++ and SDL2 for performance efficiency.

## Features of project:-
- The tool will allow users to see how data is manipulated during the sorting process.
- Users will be able to select different sorting algorithmsto visualise.
- The projects stands out bu using C++ and SDL2 library.
- It also aids in comprehending the time complexities associated with different sorting algorithms.
